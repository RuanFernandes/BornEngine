## Architecture Overview

The animation system is split into three layers:

1. **Asset loading** (`models.rs`) -- parses glTF/GLB files, extracts skeleton hierarchy, inverse bind matrices, animation channels (translation/rotation/scale keyframes per joint), and skin data (JOINTS_0 + WEIGHTS_0 vertex attributes). Since EN-055, the parsed clip data (`SkeletonData`, animations, rest rotations) is immutable and `Arc`-shared: `instantiateAnimation(src)` creates a new instance with a fresh mixer and joint state without re-parsing the GLB.

2. **Animation update** (`models.rs` + `anim_mixer.rs`) -- each frame, the per-instance `AnimMixer` (EN-028) advances clip time, crossfades between clips, applies masked additive layers and optional root motion, samples keyframes, walks the joint hierarchy to compute world transforms, and multiplies by inverse bind matrices to produce final joint matrices. These are stored in a pending buffer. (The older raw-`time` sampling path still exists for direct `updateModelAnimation` calls.)

3. **GPU skinning** (`renderer/`) -- the WGSL vertex shader (`renderer/shaders/core.rs`) applies 4-bone linear blend skinning using joint matrices from a 1024-entry uniform buffer, flushed to the GPU in `end_frame()`. A second `joints_prev` buffer at `@group(3) @binding(1)` feeds motion vectors (EN-022).

```

                       joint_matrices = world * IBM
                       set pending_joint_matrices ──→ flush to uniform buffer
drawModel           → push skinned vertices        ──→ vertex shader applies
                                                       4-bone blend skinning
endDrawing          → end_frame()                  ──→ render pass executes
```

## GPU Skinning Pipeline

### Vertex Layout

Every 3D vertex in Bloom includes joint/weight data, whether skinned or not:

```rust
// native/shared/src/renderer/types.rs
#[repr(C)]
pub struct Vertex3D {
    pub position: [f32; 3],   // @location(0) — bind-pose position
    pub normal:   [f32; 3],   // @location(1)
    pub color:    [f32; 4],   // @location(2) — vertex color or material base color
    pub uv:       [f32; 2],   // @location(3) — texture coordinates
    pub joints:   [f32; 4],   // @location(4) — bone indices (as floats)
    pub weights:  [f32; 4],   // @location(5) — bone weights (sum to 1.0)
    pub tangent:  [f32; 4],   // @location(6) — xyz tangent + w handedness
}
// Total stride: 96 bytes per vertex
```

For unskinned geometry, `joints` and `weights` are all zeros. The shader checks `total_weight > 0.01` to decide whether to apply skinning.

### Joint Uniform Buffer

Joint matrices are stored in a uniform buffer at **bind group 3, binding 0**:

```wgsl
struct JointMatrices {
    matrices: array<mat4x4<f32>, 1024>,
};
@group(3) @binding(0) var<uniform> joints: JointMatrices;
```

The buffer is 65536 bytes (1024 matrices x 64 bytes each). Initialized to identity matrices at startup. Updated via `queue.write_buffer()` in `flush_joint_matrices()` during `end_frame()`, right before the render pass. Two additions since this doc was first written: a `joints_prev` uniform at `@group(3) @binding(1)` holds last frame's matrices for motion vectors (EN-022), and the material-system pipeline binds the same joint UBO in its per-draw group at binding 1 (`renderer/material_pipeline.rs`).

### WGSL Vertex Shader (Skinning)

The 3D vertex shader performs 4-bone linear blend skinning:

```wgsl
@vertex
fn vs_main_3d(in: VertexInput3D) -> VertexOutput3D {
    let total_weight = in.weights.x + in.weights.y + in.weights.z + in.weights.w;
    var pos = vec4<f32>(in.position, 1.0);
    var norm = vec4<f32>(in.normal, 0.0);
    if (total_weight > 0.01) {
        // GPU skinning: joint matrices already include model scale
        let j0 = u32(in.joints.x); let j1 = u32(in.joints.y);
        let j2 = u32(in.joints.z); let j3 = u32(in.joints.w);
        let skinned_pos = joints.matrices[j0] * pos * in.weights.x
                        + joints.matrices[j1] * pos * in.weights.y
                        + joints.matrices[j2] * pos * in.weights.z
                        + joints.matrices[j3] * pos * in.weights.w;
        let skinned_norm = joints.matrices[j0] * norm * in.weights.x
                         + joints.matrices[j1] * norm * in.weights.y
                         + joints.matrices[j2] * norm * in.weights.z
                         + joints.matrices[j3] * norm * in.weights.w;
        pos = skinned_pos;
        norm = skinned_norm;
    }
    out.clip_position = u.mvp * pos;
    // ...
}
```

Key details:
- Joint indices are stored as floats and cast to `u32` in the shader.
- Skinned vertices pass through bind-pose positions; scale/position are baked into the joint matrices by `set_joint_matrices_scaled()`.
- Unskinned vertices have CPU-side position + scale applied in `draw_model_mesh_tinted()`.
- Normals are also skinned for correct lighting on deformed meshes.

### Bind Group Layout

The 3D pipeline uses four bind groups:

| Group | Purpose | Contents |
|-------|---------|----------|
| 0 | Transform | MVP matrix (4x4 uniform) |
| 1 | Lighting | Ambient + directional light uniforms |
| 2 | Texture | 2D texture + sampler |
| 3 | Joints | 1024 x mat4x4 uniform buffer (+ `joints_prev` at binding 1) |

### Flush Timing

Joint matrices are written to the GPU in `end_frame()` via `flush_joint_matrices()`. This happens **before** the render pass begins, ensuring all skinned draw calls in the frame see the same joint state. The flow is:

1. Game calls `updateModelAnimation()` -- computes joint matrices, stores in `pending_joint_matrices`
2. Game calls `drawModel()` -- queues skinned vertices (bind-pose positions)
3. Game calls `endDrawing()` -> `end_frame()` -> `flush_joint_matrices()` -- writes to GPU
4. Render pass executes -- shader reads joint buffer and skins vertices

## TypeScript API

### Loading

```typescript
import { loadModel, loadModelAnimation, drawModel, updateModelAnimation } from "@bornengine/engine";

// Load the mesh (vertices with skin data: JOINTS_0 + WEIGHTS_0)
const model = loadModel("assets/models/character.glb");

// Load the skeleton + animation channels (can be the same GLB file)
const animHandle = loadModelAnimation("assets/models/character.glb");
```

`loadModel(path)` returns a `Model` object with a numeric `handle`. Loads GLB/glTF files, extracting mesh geometry including joint indices and weights from `JOINTS_0` and `WEIGHTS_0` vertex attributes.

`loadModelAnimation(path)` returns a numeric handle. Parses the glTF skin (skeleton hierarchy + inverse bind matrices) and all animation clips (translation/rotation/scale keyframes per joint).

### Instancing (EN-055)

Crowds should parse each GLB **once** and instantiate per entity:

```typescript
const src = loadModelAnimation("assets/models/enemy.glb");   // one parse
const anim1 = instantiateAnimation(src);   // Arc-shared clips, fresh mixer
const anim2 = instantiateAnimation(src);   // each instance animates freely
```

`instantiateAnimation(src)` shares the immutable parsed data (skeleton, clips, rest rotations) and gives the new handle its own mixer, joint matrices, and mask cache. The shooter's boot went from ~30 re-parses of seven GLBs to seven parses.

### Updating — mixer API (preferred)

The per-instance `AnimMixer` (EN-028, `native/shared/src/anim_mixer.rs`) owns clip time, crossfades, masked layers, and opt-in root motion:

```typescript
animPlay(anim, moving ? CLIP_WALK : CLIP_IDLE, 0.15); // crossfade; idempotent per frame
const spine = findJoint(anim, "Spine");               // joint index — once, at load
animSetLayer(anim, attacking ? CLIP_ATTACK : -1, 1.0, spine); // masked layer (-1 = off)
animSetRootMotion(anim, true);                        // opt in (off by default)
animUpdate(anim, dt, scale, px, py, pz, yawRadians);  // one call per model per frame
if (animFinished(anim)) { /* non-looping clip ended */ }
const dx = animRootDelta(anim, 0);                    // root-motion delta, axis 0/1/2
```

See `src/models/index.ts` for the full surface (`animPlay`, `animSetLayer`, `animSetRootMotion`, `animUpdate`, `animFinished`, `animClipDuration`, `animRootDelta`).

### Updating — raw-time API (legacy, still supported)

```typescript
// In your game loop:
const time = getTime();  // seconds since start
updateModelAnimation(animHandle, 0, time, 1.0, playerX, playerY, playerZ, rotY);
```

`updateModelAnimation(handle, animIndex, time, scale, px, py, pz, rotY)`:
- `handle` -- animation handle from `loadModelAnimation()`
- `animIndex` -- which animation clip to play (0-based, order matches GLB)
- `time` -- current time in seconds (automatically wraps via modulo with clip duration)
- `scale` -- model scale (baked into joint matrices for correct skinned positioning)
- `px, py, pz` -- world position (baked into joint matrices)
- `rotY` -- yaw in **radians** (baked into joint matrices; note `drawModelRotated` takes degrees — these two differ deliberately, see the FFI comment in `ffi_core/models.rs`)

This function samples all animation channels at the given time, walks the skeleton hierarchy, and produces final joint matrices that include scale, position, and yaw. The matrices are staged for GPU upload.

### Rendering

```typescript
drawModel(model, { x: playerX, y: playerY, z: playerZ }, 1.0, WHITE);
```

`drawModel(model, position, scale, tint)` renders the model. For skinned meshes, the position and scale parameters are still passed but the actual transform comes from the joint matrices set by `updateModelAnimation()`. The `scale` parameter should match what was passed to `updateModelAnimation()`.

### Complete Example

```typescript
import { initWindow, windowShouldClose, beginDrawing, endDrawing,
         clearBackground, loadModel, loadModelAnimation,
         updateModelAnimation, drawModel, getTime, Colors } from "@bornengine/engine";

initWindow(800, 600, "Animation Demo");

const character = loadModel("assets/models/character.glb");
const anim = loadModelAnimation("assets/models/character.glb");

while (!windowShouldClose()) {
    const t = getTime();
    updateModelAnimation(anim, 0, t, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);

    beginDrawing();
    clearBackground(Colors.SKYBLUE);
    drawModel(character, { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }, 1.0, Colors.WHITE);
    endDrawing();
}
```

## Blender Export Pipeline

Getting animated characters from Mixamo into Bloom requires a specific export workflow. The steps below were discovered through extensive trial and error -- each one addresses a specific failure mode.

### Prerequisites

- Blender 3.6+ (glTF exporter with NLA support)
- Mixamo character + animation FBX files from the **same character pack**
- The reusable export script: `scripts/export_mixamo_glb.py`

### Manual Workflow

#### Step 1: Import Character FBX

```
File > Import > FBX > select character FBX from Mixamo
```

This gives you an armature + skinned mesh.

#### Step 2: Import Animation FBX

```
File > Import > FBX > select animation FBX (e.g., "standing run forward.fbx")
```

This creates a second armature with the animation baked as an action.

**Why same pack?** Two different Mixamo character packs have incompatible armature rest orientations. The bone hierarchy names may match, but rest-pose quaternions differ, causing joints to twist when retargeted.

#### Step 3: Transfer Animation to Character Armature

1. Find the animation action in the new armature's action list
2. Delete the imported armature (keep the action)
3. Select the character armature
4. In the Action Editor, assign the animation action to the character armature

```python
# Equivalent Blender Python:
arm_obj.animation_data_create()
arm_obj.animation_data.action = run_action
```

#### Step 4: Push Action to NLA Track

Blender's glTF exporter only exports animations that are on NLA tracks (when using `NLA_TRACKS` mode). Simply having an active action is not enough.

```python
track = arm_obj.animation_data.nla_tracks.new()
track.name = "Run"
strip = track.strips.new("Run", int(action.frame_range[0]), action)
arm_obj.animation_data.action = None  # Clear active action
```

#### Step 5: Decimate Mesh (Mobile)

For mobile targets, reduce vertex count to ~2000:

```python
mod = mesh_obj.modifiers.new(name="Dec", type='DECIMATE')
mod.ratio = 2000.0 / len(mesh_obj.data.vertices)
bpy.ops.object.modifier_apply(modifier="Dec")
```

#### Step 6: Apply Armature Scale (CRITICAL)

Mixamo FBX imports often have a 0.01 or 100x scale on the armature. This must be applied (baked into the transform) **before** export:

```python
bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')
bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = arm_obj
bpy.ops.object.transform_apply(location=True, rotation=True, scale=True)
```

**Why?** If the armature has a non-identity scale, vertex positions are in one coordinate space (meters) while bone transforms are in another (centimeters). Applying the scale unifies them.

**Warning:** If you bake animation keyframes and THEN apply scale, the baked keyframes become invalid. Apply scale first, or don't bake.

#### Step 7: Clean Up

Remove any extra objects (lights, cameras, extra meshes):

```python
for obj in list(bpy.data.objects):
    if obj not in (mesh_obj, arm_obj):
        bpy.data.objects.remove(obj, do_unlink=True)
```

#### Step 8: Export GLB with CRITICAL Settings

```python
bpy.ops.export_scene.gltf(
    filepath="output.glb",
    export_format='GLB',
    export_animations=True,
    export_skins=True,
    export_apply=False,                              # Do NOT apply modifiers
    export_texcoords=True,
    export_normals=True,
    export_image_format='JPEG',
    export_animation_mode='NLA_TRACKS',              # REQUIRED: export from NLA
    export_optimize_animation_size=False,             # CRITICAL: without this, only 2-3 keyframes survive!
    export_force_sampling=True,                       # REQUIRED: sample all frames
    export_optimize_animation_keep_anim_armature=True # REQUIRED: keep armature animations
)
```

**The most important setting is `export_optimize_animation_size=False`.** Blender's "optimize animation size" feature aggressively strips keyframes that it considers redundant. For character animation, this reduces a 30-frame walk cycle to 2-3 keyframes, producing a static T-pose or barely-twitching character. This took days to diagnose.

### Automated Script

Use the provided export script for repeatable results:

```bash
blender --background --python scripts/export_mixamo_glb.py -- \
    character.fbx walk.fbx run.fbx idle.fbx \
    -o assets/models/character.glb \
    --max-verts 2000
```

See `scripts/export_mixamo_glb.py` for full documentation.

## Common Pitfalls

### Blender Export Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Character stuck in T-pose | Keyframes stripped by optimizer | Set `export_optimize_animation_size=False` |
| Only 2-3 keyframes in GLB | Same as above | Same as above |
| Joints twist/distort | Animation from different Mixamo pack | Use character + animations from same pack |
| Animation not in GLB | Action not on NLA track | Push action to NLA track before export |
| Mesh explodes at runtime | Armature scale not applied | `bpy.ops.object.transform_apply()` before export |
| Baked animation broken after scale apply | Scale applied after baking | Apply scale BEFORE baking, or don't bake |

### Runtime Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Character slides across ground | Root joint has translation keys | Root translation is locked to rest pose by default (see `root_translation_at` in `models.rs`); enable it deliberately with `animSetRootMotion(handle, true)` and consume `animRootDelta` |
| Character renders at wrong position | Scale mismatch between `updateModelAnimation` and `drawModel` | Use same scale value in both calls |
| Character invisible / at origin | `loadModelAnimation` failed (returned 0) | Check file path; on iOS check `resolve_path()` |
| Perry crash on animation call | NaN-boxed pointer from failed load used as handle | Check return value of `loadModelAnimation()` before using |
| Lighting wrong on deformed mesh | Normals not skinned | Bloom skins normals in the vertex shader (already handled) |

### Scale Conventions

- **Mixamo FBX**: Characters are in centimeters (1 unit = 1cm). Blender's FBX importer converts to meters, adding a 0.01 armature scale.
- **BornEngine**: Expects meter-scale models. Use `scale: 1.0` for properly exported models.
- **Inverse Bind Matrices**: May contain 100x scale from Blender's cm-to-m conversion. The engine detects this and compensates (see `skin_vertex_scale` in `load_gltf_with_textures`).

## Debugging

### Debug Logging

In debug builds (`#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`), the engine prints detailed animation info to stderr:

```
[anim] Skeleton: 65 joints, 1 roots
[anim]   joint 0: 'mixamorig:Hips' children=[1, 2, 3]
[anim] Animation 'Run': 195 channels mapped, 0 skipped, duration=0.83s, avg 25/ch keyframes
[anim] joints=65, t=0.000, anim_index=0
[anim] Joint0 local: t=[0.00,96.47,0.00] r=[0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,1.0000]
[anim] Joint0 final diag=[1.0000,1.0000,1.0000] trans=[0.0000,0.0000,0.0000]
```

Things to check:
- **"channels mapped"** should be > 0 (otherwise animation data isn't being applied)
- **"avg N/ch keyframes"** should be 20+ for a typical animation (if it's 2-3, the export optimizer stripped keyframes)
- **Joint0 final diag** should be near 1.0 for a properly scaled model

### Manual Joint Testing

Use `setJointTest(jointIndex, angle)` to manually rotate a single joint, useful for verifying the skinning pipeline works before adding animation data:

```typescript
setJointTest(0, Math.sin(getTime()) * 0.8);  // wobble the root joint
```

### Verifying GLB Contents

Use `gltf-validator` or inspect the GLB in a viewer:

```bash
# Check animation keyframe counts
npx gltf-validator character.glb

# Visual inspection
# Open in https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/ or Blender
```

If the validator shows only 2-3 keyframes per channel, the Blender export optimizer stripped them -- re-export with `export_optimize_animation_size=False`.
