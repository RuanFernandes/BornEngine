# iOS target

Metal via wgpu, UIKit for the window and touch, CoreAudio for sound, and Jolt
for physics. Perry packages the engine library inside each iOS game app.

The engine ships a **static library, not an app**. There is no Xcode project
here — Perry owns the app shell (`Info.plist`, `UIApplicationMain`, the bundle,
signing). `native/ios/` is `libbloom_ios.a` and nothing else.

## Building a game

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim

perry setup ios                # once: App Store Connect API key + team id
perry setup ios --development  # once per device: registers the UDID, mints a profile

perry compile src/main.ts -o build/Game --target ios --features ios-game-loop
xcrun devicectl device install app --device <UDID> build/Game.app
xcrun devicectl device process launch --console --device <UDID> <bundle-id>
```

`--features ios-game-loop` is **mandatory** for a game and is the single most
common way to get a black screen. UIKit requires `UIApplicationMain()` to own
the main thread forever, while `Game.run()` owns the blocking game loop. The
feature makes Perry emit `_perry_user_main` — run on a spawned
game thread — and hands the main thread to `UIApplicationMain`. Without it you
get a plain `main()`, the app links, and no window ever appears.

The handshake between the two, both implemented in `native/ios/src/lib.rs`:

- `perry_register_native_classes()` — registers `BloomMetalView` (a `UIView`
  whose `+layerClass` is `CAMetalLayer`) before `UIApplicationMain` starts.
- `perry_scene_will_connect()` — creates the `UIWindow`, the view, the wgpu
  surface and the engine, on the main thread, from `didFinishLaunching`.
- `bloom_init_window()` — runs on the *game* thread and waits for the engine
  the scene delegate is building. It panics after 10s if that never happened,
  which in practice means `ios-game-loop` was omitted.

Perry omits `UIApplicationSceneManifest` from the plist in game-loop mode; older
build notes told you to strip it by hand afterwards, and that is no longer
needed.

## Assets

Perry copies `assets/` (and `logo/`, `resources/`, `images/`) from the project
root — located by walking up to the nearest `package.json` — into the `.app`.

Relative paths do **not** resolve against the working directory on iOS: the CWD
is not the app bundle. Every asset-loading FFI therefore routes its path through
the platform's `resolve_path()` hook, which prepends
`NSBundle.mainBundle.resourcePath`. If you add a new FFI that opens a file for
*reading*, it must resolve too:

```rust
let path = $crate::string_header::str_from_header(path_ptr);
let path: &str = &bloom_resolve_asset_path(path);
```

Skipping that is silent on desktop and fails only on device. `loadMaterial` /
`compileMaterialFromFile` was missing it until 2026-07, and the symptom was a
scene that rendered with every from-file material dropped — water invisible,
terrain on a fallback shader — with only a `canonicalize … No such file` line on
the console to say so. FFIs that *write* a file (`takeScreenshot`,
`dumpShadowMap`) deliberately do not resolve — the bundle is read-only.

## Input

Touch is real UIKit multitouch: up to 10 points, `setMultipleTouchEnabled: YES`,
coordinates scaled from points to pixels so they share a space with
`game.input.getScreenWidth()` / `game.input.getScreenHeight()`.

Touch 0 is also synthesised into mouse button 0, so mouse-driven games work
unmodified. That is a trap for anything multi-touch: `game.input.isMouseButtonDown(0)` is
true whenever *any* first finger is down, so an FPS that reads it as "fire" will
shoot while you are steering with the movement stick. Read the touch API
through `game.input.isTouchActive(index)` and its touch-position methods instead.

**Touch slots are not a dense list.** `game.input.getTouchCount()` is the number of live
fingers, but touch points are addressed by *slot*, and slots go sparse the moment
a finger lifts out of order — hold two fingers, lift the first, and the live
finger is at slot 1 while the count is 1. Iterating `0..game.input.getTouchCount()` then
reads slot 0 — released, but still holding its last coordinates — as if it were
live, which presents as a finger frozen where it left the glass. Scan
`0..game.input.getMaxTouchPoints()` and skip slots that `game.input.isTouchActive(i)` rejects.

Gamepad is **not** implemented on iOS (`GCController` is never polled), despite
the framework being linked. `game.input.isGamepadAvailable()` returns false. tvOS has the
code to copy if this is ever needed.

## Renderer notes

- Backend is pinned to `wgpu::Backends::METAL`; present mode is `Fifo`.
- Device creation retries: some real devices (iPhone 16 Pro / A18) advertise
  `EXPERIMENTAL_RAY_QUERY` on the adapter and then reject it at device creation,
  which would abort on launch. The fallback re-requests with `adapter.limits()`,
  because iOS GPUs also cap individual limits (e.g.
  `max_inter_stage_shader_variables` at 15, under wgpu's default 16) below the
  desktop defaults.
- Atmosphere LUTs are tiered down on iOS (`renderer/atmosphere_lut.rs`).
- Deployment target is pinned to iOS 17.0 by Perry.

## Known gaps

- **No CI build.** No workflow compiles `native/ios/`; the only iOS gate is
  `tools/validate-ffi.js`, which parses `lib.rs` for symbol names and proves
  nothing about whether the crate compiles or runs.
- **EN-024** — iOS reports pixels where macOS reports points, so screen dimensions
  and 2D HUD coordinates do not carry across Apple targets. Games currently
  compensate themselves by scaling the 2D pass through `game.renderer.begin2D(camera)`.
